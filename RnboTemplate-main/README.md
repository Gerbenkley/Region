## Customizing your web page

From this point, the sky is the limit. You can do anything and everything to your web page, adding custom graphics and interaction in whatever way you like. A full discussion of web programming is beyond the scope of this README, but some useful reading material would include:

- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
- [p5JS](https://p5js.org/)
- [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
